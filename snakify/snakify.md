##Previous and next
Write a program that reads an integer number and prints its previous and next numbers. See the examples below for the exact format your answers should take. There shouldn't be a space before the period.


```.py
a = int(input())

b = str(a + 1)
c = str(a - 1)

print('The next number for the number ' + str(a) + ' is ' + str(b) + '.')
print('The previous number for the number ' + str(a) + ' is ' + str(c) + '.')
```
